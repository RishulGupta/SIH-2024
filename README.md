## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the project submission for **Smart India Hackathon 2024** by **Team NEXTECH**. The project addresses the challenge titled **"SAR Image Colorization for Comprehensive Insight using Deep Learning Model"**.

The core objective is to enhance the interpretability of monochromatic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images by applying **deep learning-based colorization techniques**. SAR imagery, though rich in structural and textural detail, lacks color, making it less intuitive for visual analysis. By colorizing these grayscale images, we aim to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly representation for remote sensing applications.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

**Description:**  
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery offers high-resolution imaging with structural and textural richness. However, due to the absence of color, these images often require expert interpretation. By developing a Deep Learning (DL) model capable of intelligently colorizing SAR images, this project aims to significantly enhance image readability and usability for analysts.

**Challenge:**  
- Innovative preprocessing and data pairing between SAR and optical images  
- Designing a robust and scalable DL model architecture  
- Choosing appropriate loss functions for perceptual and pixel-wise accuracy  
- Ensuring generalizability across various SAR datasets and terrain types

**Desired Outcome:**  
A reliable and effective **DL-based SAR Image Colorization Software** that improves visual analysis for remote sensing professionals.
