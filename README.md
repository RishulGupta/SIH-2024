## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository hosts the submission for **Smart India Hackathon 2024** by **Team NEXTECH**. The project addresses the ISRO-provided challenge titled **"SAR Image Colorization for Comprehensive Insight using Deep Learning Model"**.

Leveraging the power of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Deep Learning (DL)**, our goal is to convert monochromatic **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** images into full-color visuals. This approach enhances human interpretation, enabling analysts to derive more meaningful insights from complex satellite data.

Our model combines **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, **image-to-image translation techniques**, and custom **loss functions** to produce perceptually realistic and geospatially accurate colorizations.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

**Description:**  
SAR images are invaluable in remote sensing due to their structural detail and independence from weather conditions. However, their lack of color makes visual analysis less intuitive. Our AI-driven solution uses paired SAR and optical imagery to train a DL model capable of intelligently applying color, bridging the gap between raw radar signals and human-friendly visuals.

**Challenges Addressed:**  
- Advanced AI-based data preprocessing and augmentation  
- Deep neural network design optimized for image translation  
- Use of perceptual and adversarial loss for realism  
- Generalization across varying terrain and SAR sensor types

**Outcome:**  
An **AI-powered SAR Colorization Software** that enhances decision-making, monitoring, and scientific interpretation in Earth observation.
